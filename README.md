### Hi there 👋, thanks for visiting my profile!  

I use this github account to publish my projects. So far, I am interested in making web extensions for fun! However, I do make web applications with python Flask and the OG HTML/CSS/JS 😎. I also took a course on React Basics. And I am maintining my TryHackMe streak by learning Cyber Security 🛡️ skills everyday!
